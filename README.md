üë®‚Äçüíª BMI-Calculator!

Welcome to my Body Index Mass Calculator project.
Body mass index (BMI) is a measure of body fat based on height and weight that applies to adult men and women.

In this project you can enter your height (in cm) and your weight (in kg) and just click on the Calculate button.
The calculator will automatically do the math and display your BMI, a small message and a chart image so that you can understand your value.

This project was made with HTML, CSS and Javascript and is for a Javascript Advance course "The Complete JavaScript Course 2022: From Zero to Expert!
" on Udemy!
